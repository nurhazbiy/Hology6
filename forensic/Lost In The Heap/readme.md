## Description

My friend and i just encrypted our file as part of security course final exam. But when i checking the file before submitting, i forget where did i save the key, and worst of all, we don't have any access to our sandbox anymore. what should we do? Luckily we do backup our sandbox on <https://s.ub.ac.id/hology6-lost-in-the-heap>

## Difficulty

easy

## Hints

> We do have backups for our sandbox, but can we trace it after we destroyed our sandbox?
