## Description

I used to have a best friend when I was little. so close he entrusted his secret collection to me and said "whatever happens to me, take good care of this collection, and delete everything if the worst happens to me." Now he is married and living happily with his family, so he said that he no longer needed the data he entrusted to me. Even though it's nice to hear, now I'm curious, what is in the data that he loves so much?

```bash
hology6@<HOST> -p <10101> 
```
